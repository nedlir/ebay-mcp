# Docker MCP Registry Example Files

This directory contains example files needed to submit the eBay API MCP Server to the Docker MCP Registry.

## Files in This Directory

### server.yaml
Example server configuration file that will be used in the Docker MCP registry. This defines:
- Server metadata (name, category, tags)
- Docker image configuration
- Required secrets and environment variables
- User-facing configuration parameters

### tools.json
Sample list of 23 representative tools from the eBay API MCP Server. This file can be used if the registry's automatic tool extraction fails. It includes tools from:
- Token management (OAuth)
- Inventory management
- Order fulfillment
- Marketing campaigns
- Account policies
- Analytics
- Category/taxonomy

### readme.md
Documentation file that will be displayed in the Docker MCP registry for your server. Links to the full repository documentation.

## How to Use These Files

When you run `task wizard` or `task create` in the docker/mcp-registry repository, you'll need to provide:

1. **GitHub URL**: `https://github.com/YosefHayim/ebay-api-mcp-server`
2. **Category**: `e-commerce`
3. **Environment Variables/Secrets**: Refer to the `config` section in `server.yaml`

If the wizard successfully extracts tools from your Dockerfile, great! If it fails, copy `tools.json` to the appropriate location:
```bash
cp tools.json /path/to/mcp-registry/servers/ebay-api-mcp-server/tools.json
```

## Expected Directory Structure in mcp-registry

After running the wizard, you should have:
```
docker/mcp-registry/
└── servers/
    └── ebay-api-mcp-server/
        ├── server.yaml    # Generated by wizard (or use example)
        ├── tools.json     # Generated by wizard (or use example)
        └── readme.md      # Copy from examples
```
