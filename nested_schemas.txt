    international shipping discount profile. If a buyer satisfies the
    requirements of the discount rule, this buyer will receive a shipping
    discount for the order. <br><br>The seller can create and manage
    shipping discount profiles using (Get/Set)
    <b>ShippingDiscountProfiles</b> calls in the <b>Trading API</b> or
    through the <b>Shipping Preferences</b> in <b>My eBay</b>.

  shippingPromotionOffered: boolean (optional)
    This boolean indicates whether or not the seller has set up a
    promotional shipping discount that will be available to buyers who
    satisfy the requirements of the shipping discount rule. <br><br>The
    seller can create and manage shipping promotional discounts using
    (Get/Set) <b>ShippingDiscountProfiles</b> calls in the <b>Trading
    API</b> or through the <b>Shipping Preferences</b> in <b>My eBay</b>.

  shippingServices: array of ShippingService (optional)
    This array consists of the domestic or international shipping services
    options that are defined for the policy. The shipping service options
    defined under this array should match what is set in the corresponding
    <b>shippingOptions.optionType</b> field (which controls whether domestic
    or international shipping service options are being defined). If a
    shipping rate table is being used, the specified shipping service
    options should also match the shipping rate table settings (domestic or
    international, shipping speed/level of service, etc.) <br><br>Sellers
    can specify up to four domestic shipping services and up to five
    international shipping service options by using separate
    <b>shippingService</b> containers for each. If the seller is using the
    Global Shipping Program as an international option, only a total of four
    international shipping service options (including GSP) can be offered.

SCHEMA: ShippingService
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: object
Description: This type is used by the <b>shippingServices</b> array, an array that provides details about every domestic and international shipping service option that is defined for the policy.

Properties:

  additionalShippingCost: Amount (optional)
    This container is used by the seller to cover the use case when a single
    buyer purchases multiple quantities of the same line item. This cost
    cannot exceed the corresponding <b>shippingCost</b> value. A seller will
    generally set this field when he/she wants to pass on a shipping
    discount to the buyer if that buyer purchases multiple quantities of a
    line item. <br><br>The seller can ship multiple quantities of the line
    item in the same package and pass on the shipping savings to the
    buyer.<br><br>If this field is not set, and a buyer purchases multiple
    quantities of an item, the seller can technically charge the same cost
    set in the <b>shippingCost</b> container for each individual item, but
    in general, it behooves both the seller and the buyer (and saves both
    parties money) if they discuss combined shipping.<br><br>This field is
    not applicable to auction listings or single-quantity, fixed-price
    listings.<br><br>This container is returned if set.

  buyerResponsibleForPickup: boolean (optional)
    This field should be included and set to <code>true</code> for a motor
    vehicle listing if it will be the buyer's responsibility to pick up the
    purchased motor vehicle after full payment is made. <br><br>This field
    is only applicable to motor vehicle listings. In the majority of motor
    vehicle listings, the seller does make the buyer responsible for pickup
    or shipment of the vehicle. <br><br>This field is returned if
    set.<br><br><b>Default</b>: false

  buyerResponsibleForShipping: boolean (optional)
    This field should be included and set to <code>true</code> for a motor
    vehicle listing if it will be the buyer's responsibility to arrange for
    shipment of a motor vehicle. <br><br>This field is only applicable to
    motor vehicle listings. In the majority of motor vehicle listings, the
    seller does make the buyer responsible for pickup or shipment of the
    vehicle. <br><br>This field is returned if set.<br><br><b>Default</b>:
    false

  freeShipping: boolean (optional)
    This field is included and set to <code>true</code> if the seller offers
    a free domestic shipping option to the buyer. <br><br>This field can
    only be included and set to <code>true</code> for the first domestic
    shipping service option specified in the <b>shippingServices</b> array
    (it is ignored if set for subsequent shipping services or for any
    international shipping service option). <br><br>The first specified
    shipping service option has a <b>sortOrder</b> value of <code>1</code>
    or if the <b>sortOrderId</b> field is not used, it is the shipping
    service option that's specified first in the <b>shippingServices</b>
    array.<br><br>This container is returned if set.

  shipToLocations: RegionSet (optional)
    This container is used to set the ship-to locations applicable to the
    corresponding shipping service option. Although the
    <b>regionExcluded</b> container is defined for <b>RegionSet</b> type and
    could technically be used here, it is recommened that only the
    <b>regionIncluded</b> container be used at the shipping service level.
    The excluded shipping regions (if any) can instead be set up in the top-
    level <b>regionExcluded</b> container. <br><br>The <b>regionIncluded</b>
    and <b>regionExcluded</b> containers define the geographical
    regions/countries/states or provinces/domestic regions where the seller
    does and doesn't ship to with this fulfillment policy.<br><br>To
    retrieve the valid geographical shipping region values, two-digit
    country values, or special domestic regions for an eBay marketplace,
    call <a href="/devzone/xml/docs/reference/ebay/GeteBayDetails.html">Gete
    BayDetails</a> with <b>DetailName</b> value set to
    <code>ExcludeShippingLocationDetails</code>, then review the
    <b>ExcludeShippingLocationDetails</b> containers in the response for the
    strings you use in the <b>regionIncluded.regionName</b> field.
    <ul><li>For valid geographical region names, look for the
    <code>ExcludeShippingLocationDetails</code> containers in the
    <b>GeteBayDetails</b> response where the <b>Region</b> value is
    <code>Worldwide</code>, and the valid values will be shown in the
    corresponding <b>Location</b> fields.</li> <li>For valid two-digit
    country codes, look for <code>ExcludeShippingLocationDetails</code> in
    the <b>GeteBayDetails</b> response where the <b>Region</b> value is one
    of the defined geographical regions, and the valid values will be shown
    in the corresponding <b>Location</b> fields. Alternatively, you can find
    the two-digit country code values in the <a href="/api-
    docs/sell/account/types/ba:CountryCodeEnum">CountryCodeEnum</a> type
    definition.</li>  <li>For valid domestic region values, look for
    <code>ExcludeShippingLocationDetails</code> in the <b>GeteBayDetails</b>
    response where the <b>Region</b> value is either <code>Domestic
    Location</code> or <code>Additional Locations</code>, and the valid
    values will be shown in the corresponding <b>Location</b>
    fields.</li></ul> The <code>STATE_OR_PROVINCE</code> region type is only
    applicable to the US and Canada, and valid values for US states are the
    same <a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/state-
    abbreviations.htm ">two-digit abbreviations</a> used by the United
    States Postal Service, and valid values for Canadian provinces and
    territories are the same <a href="https://www.canadapost-
    postescanada.ca/cpc/en/support/articles/addressing-guidelines/symbols-
    and-abbreviations.page ">two-digit abbreviations</a> used by the Canada
    Post.

  shippingCarrierCode: string (optional)
    This field sets/indicates the shipping carrier, such as
    <code>USPS</code>, <code>FedEx</code>, or <code>UPS</code>. Although
    this field uses the <b>string</b> type, the seller must pass in a pre-
    defined enumeration value here. <br><br>For a full list of shipping
    carrier enum values for a specified eBay marketplace, the <a href="/devz
    one/xml/docs/reference/ebay/GeteBayDetails.html">GeteBayDetails</a> call
    of the <b>Trading API</b> can be used, and the <b>DetailName</b> field's
    value should be set to <code>ShippingCarrierDetails</code>. The enum
    values for each shipping carriers can be found in each
    <b>ShippingCarrierDetails.ShippingCarrier</b> field in the response
    payload.<br><br> This field is actually optional, as the shipping
    carrier is also tied into the <b>shippingServiceCode</b> enum value, and
    that field is required for every specified shipping service
    option.<br><br>This field is returned if set.

  shippingCost: Amount (optional)
    This container is used to set the shipping cost to ship one item using
    the corresponding shipping service option. This container is
    conditionally required if the seller is using flat-rate shipping and is
    not using a domestic or international shipping rate table. <br><br>This
    container is not necessary for calculated shipping, since eBay will
    calculate the shipping cost and display it in the View Item page based
    off of the potential buyer's ship-to location.<br><br>This value is
    automatically set to <code>0.0</code> for the first specified domestic
    shipping service option and if the corresponding <b>freeShipping</b>
    field is set to <code>true</code>.  <br><br>This container is returned
    if set for the policy.

  shippingServiceCode: string (optional)
    This field sets/indicates the domestic or international shipping service
    option, such as <code>USPSPriority</code>, <code>FedEx2Day</code>, or
    <code>UPS3rdDay</code>. Although this field uses the <b>string</b> type,
    the seller must pass in a pre-defined enumeration value here.
    <br><br>For a full list of shipping service option enum values for a
    specified eBay marketplace, the <a href="/devzone/xml/docs/reference/eba
    y/GeteBayDetails.html">GeteBayDetails</a> call of the <b>Trading API</b>
    can be used, and the <b>DetailName</b> field's value should be set to
    <code>ShippingServiceDetails</code>. <br><br>The enum values for each
    shipping service option can be found in each
    <b>ShippingServiceDetails.ShippingService</b> field in the response
    payload. The seller must make sure that the shipping service option is
    still valid, which is indicated by a <code>true</code> value in the
    corresponding <b>ValidForSellingFlow</b> boolean field. International
    shipping service options are typically returned at the top of the
    response payload, and are indicated by an <b>InternationalService</b>
    boolean field that reads <code>true</code>. <br><br>The
    <b>InternationalService</b> boolean field is not returned at all for
    domestic shipping service options. <br><br> This field is required for
    every specified shipping service option.

  sortOrder: integer(int32) (optional)
    The integer value set in this field controls the order of the
    corresponding domestic or international shipping service option in the
    View Item and Checkout pages. <br><br>If the <b>sortOrder</b> field is
    not supplied, the order of domestic and international shipping service
    options is determined by the order in which they are listed in the API
    call. <br><br><b>Min</b>: 1. <b>Max</b>: 4 (for domestic shipping
    service) or 5 (for international shipping service).

  surcharge: Amount (optional)
    <span class="tablenote"> <strong>Note:</strong> DO NOT USE THIS FIELD.
    Shipping surcharges for domestic shipping service options can no longer
    be set with fulfillment business policies, except through shipping rate
    tables. <br><br>To do this, a seller would set up a surcharge-based
    shipping rate table and specify the surcharge in that table. Then, the
    seller would need to associate this shipping rate table to the
    fulfillment business policy by specifying the unique ID of the shipping
    rate table through the <b>shippingOptions.rateTableId</b> field.
    </span>Shipping surcharges cannot be applied at all to international
    shipping service options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCHEMA: TimeDuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: object
Description: A type used to specify a period of time using a specified time-measurement unit. Payment, return, and fulfillment business policies all use this type to specify time windows.<br><br>Whenever a container that uses this type is used in a request, both of these fields are required. Similarly, whenever a container that uses this type is returned in a response, both of these fields are always returned.

Properties:

  unit: string (optional)
    These enum values represent the time measurement unit, such as
    <code>DAY</code>. A span of time is defined when you apply the value
    specified in the <b>value</b> field to the value specified for
    <b>unit</b>. <br><br>See <b>TimeDurationUnitEnum</b> for a complete list
    of possible time-measurement units. For implementation help, refer to <a
    href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-
    docs/sell/account/types/ba:TimeDurationUnitEnum'>eBay API
    documentation</a>

  value: integer(int32) (optional)
    An integer that represents an amount of time, as measured by the time-
    measurement unit specified in the <b>unit</b> field.
