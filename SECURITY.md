## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ebay-mcp seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Report via GitHub Security Advisory: https://github.com/YosefHayim/ebay-mcp/security/advisories/new
3. Or email security reports to: **yosefhayim.sabag@gmail.com**
4. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with assessment and timeline
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities patched within 14 days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after patch is available

### Scope

Security vulnerabilities we consider in-scope:

- Authentication bypass
- Token exposure or theft
- OAuth flow vulnerabilities
- Injection attacks (SQL, Command, etc.)
- Sensitive data exposure
- Access control issues
- Cryptographic vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### Token Security

#### `.env (tokens stored as EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN)` File

This file contains sensitive OAuth tokens and **MUST** be protected:

```bash
# Set restrictive permissions (Unix/Linux/macOS)
chmod 600 .env (tokens stored as EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN)

# Verify permissions
ls -l .env (tokens stored as EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN)
# Should show: -rw------- (owner read/write only)
```

**Security Checklist**:
- ✅ File is in `.gitignore` (already configured)
- ✅ Restrictive file permissions (600)
- ✅ Not committed to version control
- ✅ Not shared in plain text (email, chat, etc.)
- ✅ Backed up securely (encrypted backups only)
- ✅ Token file located outside of web-accessible directories

#### Environment Variables

Never hardcode credentials in source code:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Don't do this
export EBAY_CLIENT_ID="your_app_id_here"

# ✅ CORRECT - Use secure env var management
# Option 1: .env file (add to .gitignore)
# Option 2: System keychain/secrets manager
# Option 3: CI/CD secrets (GitHub Secrets, etc.)
```

#### Token Rotation

- **Access tokens**: Auto-refresh every ~2 hours (eBay default)
- **Refresh tokens**: Rotate every 6-12 months (manual re-authentication)
- **App credentials**: Rotate annually or immediately if compromised

### HTTP Server Security (When Using HTTP Transport)

#### OAuth 2.1 Configuration

```bash
# Always use HTTPS in production
OAUTH_AUTH_SERVER_URL=https://auth.example.com  # NOT http://

# Strong client secrets (32+ chars, random)
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# Require JWT validation or introspection
OAUTH_USE_INTROSPECTION=true

# Enforce required scopes
OAUTH_REQUIRED_SCOPES="mcp:tools"
```

#### Network Security

**Production Deployment**:
- ✅ Use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ only
- ✅ Enable CORS with specific origins (not `*`)
- ✅ Implement rate limiting
- ✅ Use secure session management
- ✅ Enable security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

**Example secure setup**:
```javascript
// In src/server-http.ts
app.use(helmet());  // Security headers
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://trusted-client.com',  // NOT '*'
  credentials: true
}));
```

### Dependency Security

#### Regular Updates

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically (review changes first!)
npm audit fix

# Update to latest secure versions
npm update

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

#### GitHub Security Features

- ✅ Enable Dependabot alerts (automatically enabled)
- ✅ Enable Dependabot security updates
- ✅ Enable code scanning (CodeQL)
- ✅ Review dependency graph regularly

### Sandbox vs Production

#### Use Sandbox for Development

```bash
# Development/testing
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
EBAY_CLIENT_ID="sandbox_app_id"

# Production (only after thorough testing)
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
EBAY_CLIENT_ID="production_app_id"
```

**Never**:
- ❌ Use production credentials in development
- ❌ Test with real user data
- ❌ Share production tokens across environments

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

**User Token Limits** (per eBay account):
- Free tier: 10,000 req/day
- Business tier: 50,000 req/day

**App Token Limits**:
- All tiers: 1,000 req/day

**Client-side rate limiting** (this MCP server):
- 5,000 req/min (conservative limit)
- Automatic backoff on 429 responses
- Exponential retry on 5xx errors

### Logging & Monitoring

#### What to Log

```bash
# ✅ DO log
- API request counts
- Error rates
- Authentication attempts (success/failure counts)
- Token refresh attempts
- Rate limit hits

# ❌ DO NOT log
- Access tokens
- Refresh tokens
- User credentials
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Full request/response bodies (may contain tokens)
```

#### Debug Mode Security

```bash
# Debug mode may log sensitive data
EBAY_DEBUG=true  # NEVER use in production

# Production
EBAY_DEBUG=false  # Default, recommended
```

## Security Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

1. **Reporter notifies maintainers privately**
2. **Maintainers confirm and assess severity**
3. **Patch developed and tested**
4. **Security advisory published** (GitHub Security Advisories)
5. **Patch released with CVE** (if applicable)
6. **Public disclosure** (30 days after patch or coordinated date)

### Credit

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be credited in:
- `CHANGELOG.md` security section
- GitHub Security Advisory
- Release notes

## Security Tools & Resources

### Static Analysis

```bash
# ESLint security rules (already configured)
npm run lint

# Type checking (prevents many issues)
npm run typecheck

# Dependency audit
npm audit
```

### Runtime Protection

**Automatic**:
- ✅ Zod input validation (all MCP tools)
- ✅ TypeScript type safety
- ✅ OAuth token validation (HTTP mode)
- ✅ Rate limiting (client-side)
- ✅ Automatic token refresh

**Manual** (configure as needed):
- JWT signature verification (HTTP mode)
- Token introspection (HTTP mode)
- Request/response logging (debug mode only)
