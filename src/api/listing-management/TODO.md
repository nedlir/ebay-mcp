# Listing Management API

## Status

✅ **All endpoints implemented and tested** (v1.1.4)

### Inventory API (`inventory.ts`)
- 100% function coverage
- 83.5% line coverage
- 30 endpoints fully tested
- Comprehensive bulk operation support

## Future Improvements

- **Line Coverage:** Improve line coverage from 83.5% to 90%+ (focus on error handling paths)
- **Type Safety:** Consider adding more specific TypeScript interfaces for complex request/response objects
- **Retry Logic:** Retry logic already implemented in client.ts with exponential backoff
