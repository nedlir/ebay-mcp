## Configuration

> 📖 **For a comprehensive configuration guide with detailed explanations of all environment variables, OAuth flow steps, and troubleshooting, see [Configuration Documentation](docs/auth/CONFIGURATION.md).**

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your eBay credentials:

```bash
EBAY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or "production"
EBAY_REDIRECT_URI=your_runame

# Optional: For higher rate limits (10k-50k req/day)
EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

### OAuth Authentication

**Client Credentials (Automatic):**
- Default authentication method
- 1,000 requests/day
- No setup required beyond client ID and secret

**User Tokens (Recommended for Production):**
- 10,000-50,000 requests/day
- Use `ebay_get_oauth_url` tool to generate authorization URL
- Add `EBAY_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN` to `.env` after OAuth flow
- Tokens refresh automatically

For detailed OAuth setup and comprehensive configuration guide, see the [Configuration Documentation](docs/auth/CONFIGURATION.md).

### MCP Client Compatibility

This server is compatible with any MCP client that supports STDIO transport:

**Tested and Supported:**
- ✅ **Claude Desktop** (macOS, Windows, Linux) - Full support
- ✅ **MCP Inspector** - For development and testing
- ✅ **Custom MCP Clients** - Via STDIO or HTTP transport

**Configuration Requirements:**
- MCP Protocol version: 1.0+
- Transport: STDIO (default) or HTTP
- Node.js runtime: 18.0.0 or higher

**Other MCP Clients:**

While not specifically tested, the server should work with any MCP-compliant client including:
- Continue.dev
- Other editors with MCP support
- Custom implementations

If you successfully use this server with another MCP client, please let us know by [opening a discussion](https://github.com/YosefHayim/ebay-mcp/discussions)!

### Rate Limiting

Understanding eBay API rate limits is crucial for production use:

**Client Credentials (Default):**
- **Daily Limit:** 1,000 requests per day
- **Best For:** Development, testing, low-volume operations
- **Setup:** Automatic with just Client ID and Secret

**User Token (Recommended):**
- **Daily Limit:** 10,000-50,000 requests per day (varies by account type)
- **Best For:** Production, high-volume operations
- **Setup:** Requires OAuth flow (use `ebay_get_oauth_url` tool)

**Rate Limit Tiers by Account Type:**
- Individual Developer: 10,000 requests/day
- Commercial Developer: 25,000 requests/day
- Enterprise: 50,000+ requests/day (custom limits)

**Rate Limit Best Practices:**
1. Use user tokens for production workloads
2. Implement exponential backoff on rate limit errors
3. Cache responses when possible
4. Monitor your usage in the eBay Developer Portal
5. Batch operations when the API supports it
6. Consider upgrading your developer account tier for higher limits

**Handling Rate Limits:**

When you hit a rate limit, the API returns a 429 status code. The server will:
- Automatically retry with exponential backoff
- Inform you of rate limit errors
- Suggest upgrading to user token authentication

**Check Current Usage:**

Monitor your API usage in the [eBay Developer Portal](https://developer.ebay.com/my/api_usage).

## Usage Examples

Here are some common tasks you can accomplish with the eBay MCP server:

### Setting Up OAuth for Higher Rate Limits

**User:** "Can you help me set up OAuth authentication for my eBay account?"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_get_oauth_url` tool to generate an authorization URL. You visit the URL, grant permissions, and the assistant helps you configure the refresh token in your `.env` file.

**Result:** Access to 10,000-50,000 API requests per day instead of 1,000.

### Managing Inventory

**User:** "Show me all my active listings on eBay"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_get_inventory_items` to retrieve all inventory items.

**Result:** Displays a formatted list of all your products with SKUs, quantities, and status.

### Processing Orders

**User:** "Get all unfulfilled orders from the last 7 days"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_get_orders` with date filters and fulfillment status parameters.

**Result:** Returns a list of pending orders ready for shipment processing.

### Creating Marketing Campaigns

**User:** "Create a promoted listing campaign for my electronics category"

**Assistant:** Uses `ebay_create_campaign` and related marketing tools to set up ad campaigns.

**Result:** New campaign created with specified budget and target items.

### Bulk Operations

**User:** "Update prices for all items in category 'Vintage Watches' with a 10% discount"

**Assistant:** Combines `ebay_get_inventory_items`, filters by category, and uses `ebay_update_offer` to apply bulk pricing changes.

**Result:** All matching items updated with new pricing.
